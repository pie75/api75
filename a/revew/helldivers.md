title: "HELLDIVERS"
---
Helldivers is a top-down twin-stick shooter developed (and as of the writing of this review, maintained,) by Arrowhead Game Studios AB, an independent Video game developer located in Sweden.

Helldivers catapults you, and up to 3 friends (or strangers) behind, and directly into, enemy lines -  
As a member of Earth's elite military shocktroopers, the Helldivers, you will come face-to-ugly-face against 3 disgusting alien races, who are totally and utterly evil, using everything at their disposal in order to completely euthanize humanity.  
Your mission is simple: Spread Managed Democracy throughout the galaxy, eradicate the alien threat, and save the galaxy.  

Helldivers is objective-based, and enemies are limitless to enforce this.  
As a rule, you are gravely outnumbered, forcing you to be strategic about movement and map-control.  
There are very few rules in Helldivers, but those that exist are enforced clearly, and without error.  
This puts a wide variety of playing options at your disposal, mostly decided by your equipment.  
Equipment is the cornerstone of Helldivers, both as soldiers, and as a game.  
Before missions, you are granted a pick of 1 perk, 1 primary firearm, and 4 strategems.  
Strategems are critical to success, as is stressed in the tutorial, and quickly realized in the field.  
Strategems provide any and all heavy ordinance, ranging from simple resupply crates, to tactical nuclear warheads.  
With the exception of offensive/explosive ordinance, all strategems are delivered in the same caring package as the Helldivers themselves: The Hellpod.  
Hellpods are supersonic shock-absorbing tubes, which crash directly into a planet and bury themselves just enough to make their cargo accessible.  

## Politics
If all this sounds incredibly insane, then perhaps you still have your senses.  
The world of Helldivers is clearly dystopian; it mimics that of the world showcased in the 1997 film, Starship Troopers, which it takes inspiration from. If you've watched that movie, or if you know about its history, you'd know that it was created as a sarcastic political message. It takes many icons of the commonly villainous World War 2 Nazi Germans, and places them at the centre of the film, amplifying them to comedic extremes, and then mock-praising what the film-makers (and society at large) believe to be absurdities in human behaviour.  
Helldivers is no different; All along the way, you are forced into praising 'Super-Earth', a corporation with near-full-control over humanity. As a Helldiver, you are the spearhead of their greed-fueled expanse into outerspace.  

However, the galaxy is filled with life, always making itself a pest in our plans, of which three kinds are quickly marked as enemies of mankind, and accompanied with _familiar_ reasons for their eradication.

Among the enemies of Super-Earth are the "Bugs", A superspecies of primitive crustaceans who are promptly marked for enslavement and population control, due to their corpses quickly degrading into usable black oil. This remarkable benefit, however, is told to be merely a side-effect of the greater need to save humanity from their infestatious expanse.

A second alien species also earns a notable status for being in obstruction of Super-Earth's reign among the stars: The Illuminate, or "Squ'ith", as they are said to refer to themselves. Highly Sophisticated, their civilization is far older than humanity, and possesses advanced technology, extremely enticing to those in charge of Super-Earth. Their existence is marked as threat, seeing as they are in possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction which could pose a threat to anyone living among the stars, most notably, Super-Earth.

And finally, the third enemy of manking: mankind itself. Or more specifically, The Cyborgs. Obviously Undemocratic, and with modifications which are an affront to the virtuous purity of Super-Earth and its adherance to the natural order of beings, their status as terrorists prove a threat to the peaceful lifestyle of Super-Earth. A Red Star (literally) among the constellation, their obvious fixation on mas destruction, devastation, and ruination drives them to adopt the violent stance that "Supear Earth's ideals are a lie and the people are brain washed" A truly heretical stance.

Super Earth is a comical representation of the military-industrial complex; the absurdities of its warfare; and the futility of a society indoctrinated by generations of political infantilisation, instilled with the belief that the brutal dictatorship they live in is the peak of democracy and morality. It takes a more modern approach to the same sarcastic message that Starship Troopers portrayed, and as such, the target of its mockery should be familiar to most adults reading this. As a hint to those it
