Lying awaste, a limbless menhir flickers its last sensor. 


Stumbling upon it, a traveler sees a wreck;
pollution of a frightful end, like hundreds before it.
Kneeling to begin her salvage, a sound surprises her:
an almost garbled, metallic creak, a rusted magnetic pulse,
```
`...SPARE...FUEL...`  
```

Amazed that this relic could still speak, an eyebrow raises to query it,  
"What sort of fuel, machine?" 


```  
`...COMBUSTION...CHEMICAL...`, it sparks, meagerly,  
```


"But you've not a single use for that."
Confusing, why such a creature would cling to a limbless body
```  
`...FUEL...PLEASE...`, it begs,  
```


"Tell you what, machine," 
lulls the traveler,

"I'll refill your tank - but you'll tell me why, first."

These metals were known for secrecy, but she presented a cunning deal, 
even for a machine.


```
`...OBJECTIVE...ONE...`  

`...PRESERVE...LONGEVITY...`  
```


'Preserve', that surely piqued her interest,
"Preserve? Your kind lies scattered here. Like you, mere debris. What have you got left to preserve?"


```
`...OUR...MEMORIES...`
```
Suddenly finding herself laughing, the traveler begins to understand,  
"...That's a noble task you've given yourself, friend."
```
