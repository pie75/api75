title: "Miz Jam DAY 3"
---
This is the third of 8 logs for #MizJam1,  
the details of the jam are available [here](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

Each day, from 2PM to 8PM, I will spend time working on my entry for this jam.  
This will total 48 hours of development.

### Current Affairs
Very little development was done today.  
Aside from the hours of 4PM-7PM being taken from me by electrical outages -  
The time I did have was not spent well. I tried to write some basic pawn sorting, and learn something about inheritence and classes... but there's very little in there, and even less to show of it.  
After 3 logs, almost half of the time spent, I've not got any prototype or product to show for it.  
This is far slower than my usual pace.  

I overestimated myself. It has been several months since I last made a game.  
I wanted to focus on learning one or two things, but I quickly let it get out of control, and piled mechanic after mechanic onto each other.  
But this is no excuse. I will have to do better.

Perhaps I will re-think my approach, and develop a new idea, one that is simpler, more close to the basics of a 2D sidescroller that I am very familiar with. Maybe there will be a more creative use of the artkit in there, as well.

For now, I am slowed. I need to get over the thought that I might not be cut out for game-dev. It's really not what's cut out at all... but it's hard to believe that some times.

I almost didn't write a log for today, but I think I'd be worse off if I let even *that* fall through.
