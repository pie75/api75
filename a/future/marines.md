title: "Some notes on Expeditionary Marines."
---
Expeditionary Marines, EM's, or simply 'Marines' is a generalised term for the majority of fighting forces in the present day. The distinction is important, because being an Expeditionary Marine is not a career, so much as it is a task.

Marines form the basic militia, invasion force, exploration teams - really, any role at all - for almost anyone in the universe.
The distinguishing mark of a Marine is not so much their purpose, and more in line with their appearance.
A Marine is typically heavily armed and armoured, more-so than formal soldiers or officers on colonial worlds and stations. A Marine is almost exclusively covered from head-to-toe, their body and identity protected from the vacuum of space at all times, save for the single name-tag printed on their armour - usually somewhere on their back, to make their designation clear to those behind them.
Anyone can be a Marine, it's a matter of getting company-branded armour and an assignment.
Usually, that armour is some variant of Type-L, or Type-N exo-skeleton.
If you're particularly unlucky, your company might leave you in a Type-J; 
Or if you're particularly wealthy, you might personally own an older variant of Type-F.

In another time, they might have simply been called Mercenaries, but being a Marine is a particular kind of job.
Sometimes simple, sometimes dangerous, but usually unique, your tasks are things that the company would rather not expend more resources on, but certainly requires a high skill for.

It's a common trope, among the lower-class veterans, that Expeditionary was a misspelling of Expendable - but the fact that marines are typically given company assets as expensive as exo-skeletons means there's a rather high investment, and that makes it particularly hard to throw them away.
