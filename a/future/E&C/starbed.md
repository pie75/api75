title: "Starbed"

The hulking EVA suit slowed from its brisk jog, down the dark, eery corridors.

"This should be far enough away. Alone... Safe, for now...", I mumble.
I sit down, slowly, carefully, trying my best not to make a noise.
A backbending task, with this great steel gorilla encompassing me.
But, with a fine touch, and a finer eye, I manage to lay myself down,
'comfortably' against the cold station floor, suit and all.
Derelict space stations are not the most gentle resting grounds.
"At least I've got AC in here," I giggle to myself.
These last few weeks have fallen hard on me,
and it seems they're pulling my eyelids with them.

...

It's a little dark out - but the sky is... bright... and faint.
The stars are watching, right above; lively; lifeless, as they may be.
And to my left, there she is, next to me. Ceal... her gentle green gaze, glittering with the view she loved to see.
Our hands, clasped, softly, like a moon, to her planet's boon - dancing; slowly, slowly, through the curved horizon,
keeping the cold night bright - ah - like a lost light-bug,
through the sky, she points; and from the ground, my eyes wander; green as the sea, a reflection,
our eyes set together; as the crescent on her face - ah - like the sun, lights my core ablaze,
she parts her lips, as if to speak -

Echoing, through the darkness, a screech -

She hears them now. abruptly. awoken. afraid.
Her left hand. Clawing. Her pistol. Almost within reach.
She draws it. Pulled from her leg. That last ally between her.
And the dead.

In Memoriam, "Ceal", etched along its length.

Emma heeds the tightness on her bare,
"One last time," she whispers, in wobbled speech,
"- Just hold my hand, and show me where."
