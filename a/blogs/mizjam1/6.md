title: "Miz Jam DAY 5"
---
This is the sixth of 8 logs for #MizJam1,  
the details of the jam are available [here](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

Each day, from 2PM to 8PM, I will spend time working on my entry for this jam.  
This will total 48 hours of development.

### Development
The first three boid rules were implemented.  
I initially tried writing my own functions that used the same inputs as the player, with the intention of having angles and distances to other ships influence the turning and acceleration respectively.  
This proved very difficult, and far too complex, as my knowledge of Vector maths is rudimentary at best.  
I then settled on using codat's code almost exactly was it was, funneling the steer function into the acceleration and turning.

Afterward, an additional ship type was added, to set up the behaviour necessary for two opposing swarms.  
However, doing that was not as simple as I'd hoped.  
I'd hoped that simply making the second ships a different script with a different class name would prevent the two from interacting, but it seems that the scripts interact with all other instances of the same class.  
This may be an illusion, though, and it's possible, if not likely, that I am missing something.  
I don't have the time to fix it today, so I will do it tomorrow.
