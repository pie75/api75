title: "Miz Jam DAY 8"
---
This is the last of 8 logs for #MizJam1,  
the details of the jam are available [here](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

Each day, from 2PM to 8PM, I will spend time working on my entry for this jam.  
This will total 48 hours of development.

### Development
Avoidance and Hunting were implemented. Pulses were given the abilty to kill ships.  
These mechanics combine to make more competitive interactions; but it still isn't much of a game.  
I tried to squeeze in some static turrets, but I just ran out of time.  
I learned some things about signals, that will come in handy.

### The End
A game was not produced by the end of this jam. That's alright. I just have to wait for the next jam.  
I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said. I'll upload the existing game source to github tomorrow.  
I'll link it [here](https://github.com/pie75/mizjam1) when I do so.

I'll finish the game in the coming weeks, implement a victory mechanic and so on.  
I like the idea of having a classic team objective like capture the flag or destroying a base, so that's what the game'll be about.  
I'll call it something like 'Loyal wingmen.'

That's all for now, see you next time, and thanks for reading!
