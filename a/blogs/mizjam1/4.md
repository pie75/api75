title: "Miz Jam DAY 4"
---
This is the fourth of 8 logs for #MizJam1,  
the details of the jam are available [here](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

Each day, from 2PM to 8PM, I will spend time working on my entry for this jam.  
This will total 48 hours of development.

### Development
I spent some time today making the grid control system. Thanks to a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9laHKHYNyXc) and example [code](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-demos/tree/master/2018/06-09-grid-based-movement) from [GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ), I managed to gain a proper understanding of how I should and could manage pawns on a board, and their interactions.

The basic idea is to manage interactions through a TileMap, and then manage the specifics of the pawns in their own objects.  
The Board would contain the immediate data, locations, collissions, and the pawns would hold their own statistics such as health and attacks.

With this knowledge, I managed to implement pawns moving and interacting with each other. It wouldn't be too difficult to make them attack and disappear, as they do in chess.  
Though, it does bring to my attention something I overlooked earlier:  
Communicating the interactions of pieces to the player.  
In Chess, pieces only have a single, relatively unambiguous interaction: a piece that attacks another takes its spot on the board, and the lost piece is removed from play. One could say, that chess pieces all function through 'melee' or 'direct' attacks.  
With this in mind, complications arise when trying to implement 'ranged' or 'indirect' attacks. The specific rules of 'indirect' attacks are usually more complex, and they need to be communicated effectively, through marking valid targets and the effects of each shot.

Additionally, without hitpoints clearly visible, the effects of an attack that doesn't immediately remove the piece from play are not clear.
The design of a turn-based strategy does become far more complicated as the game becomes more interesting.  
I'm not sure I'm prepared for this.
