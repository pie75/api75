title: "Miz Jam DAY 2"
---
This is the second of 8 logs for #MizJam1,  
the details of the jam are available [here](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1).

Each day, from 2PM to 8PM, I will spend time working on my entry for this jam.  
This will total 48 hours of development.

### Development
After 12 hours of work, I have not managed much.  
I spent some time skipping between Godot and GameMaker:Studio 2, but ultimately settled on Godot, as I know less about it, but will probably find more future use in it.

I spent a section of today's 6 hours working out UI design.  
The UI is pretty much completely planned out.  
...Not a particularly *useful* thing, but it is good to have it out of the way.  
There is a 12x12 Grid on the left side of the screen, with alphanumeric notation to make navigating it easier.  
On the right side, is a pair of menus:  
At the top is a 4x4 Grid that will hold unit information, the particulars of enemies and allies on the board.  
At the bottom is a chatbox, which will be styled similarly to discord, with the Unit Icon displayed on the left, with its name after, and a text message appearing under.

The rest of the 6 hours were mostly spent learning how to work in Godot, and looking for specific structures that may aid me in creating a type of game I've never made before.  
(technically, I have made a tile-based text-chat game before, but that was different enough that it's not comparable)  
I have learned the very basics of working in Godot, navigating the menus, understanding scenes, and how they interact. I also vitally learned how to attach scripts to things, so there's that.  
I've made a tilemap and arranged some nodes that I think I'll need, but I'm not yet quite sure where to put the code for handling the game's grid logic. I will deal with it tomorrow.  
Godot doesn't have a designated 'Datastructure grid' function like GameMaker does, as far as I can see - though that is compensated for by an array system that is far more versatile. I will have to become accustomed to this.

I've spent the rest of this time doing more 'paper planning.'  
I've worked out the following:
The game will have a class system. Each suit of cards will represent a specific class, with its own stats. Stats will be identical between different units of the same class, but I have yet to decide if they will be available to the player. There'll only be four player units on the map at once, but I'll design scenarios around having multiple of the same class of unit.  
Enemy units will also have classes, which will be denoted by circular sprites from the artkit.  
In the information menu, each player unit will have two items, one showing their weapon, and whether it is able to fire, and the other showing their class-specific item. Each enemy will have one item.  
For now, the only class specific item I have decided on is an energy shield.
